To characterize its audio aura, I would calculate the average
energy, valence, and danceability of the 100 songs in songs.db.
If the average values ​​are high (e.g., >0.7), the aura would be "energetic, positive, and danceable."
If the energy is high but the valence is low, it would be "intense but melancholic."

Query to calculate the aura:

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(energy), 3) AS average_energy,
    ROUND(AVG(valence), 3) AS average_valence,
    ROUND(AVG(danceability), 3) AS average_danceability,
    CASE
        WHEN AVG(energy) > 0.7 AND AVG(valence) > 0.7 THEN 'Euphoric Aura: Energetic and Positive'
        WHEN AVG(energy) > 0.7 AND AVG(valence) < 0.4 THEN 'Intense Aura: Energetic but Serious'
        WHEN AVG(energy) < 0.4 AND AVG(valence) > 0.7 THEN 'Calm Aura: Relaxed and Joyful'
        WHEN AVG(energy) < 0.4 AND AVG(valence) < 0.4 THEN 'Introspective Aura: Calm and Melancholic'
        ELSE 'Balanced Aura: Mixed and Well-Rounded'
    END AS aura_description
FROM songs;

Hypotheses:
Averaging flattens differences: Opposing songs (e.g., energetic rock and a sad ballad) are averaged into a mean value that doesn't represent either.
They all count the same: Without playback data, we don't know if some songs were listened to 100 times and others only 10.
It ignores temporal patterns: Moods could have varied by month or hour, but we only have an annual average.

Proposed improvements:

Group by mood profile.
Include artist data to see if one artist dominates the profile.
Use percentiles to avoid distortion from extreme values.
